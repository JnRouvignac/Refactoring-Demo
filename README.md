# Refactoring demo

Refactoring demo used for:
- AlpesJUG, 24th February 2015
- Soft-Shake, 22nd October 2015

## Instructions

A contrived but simple example showing how refactorings can help simplify code.
Try to refactor, starting from the `CommonPrinter.printIfCommon()` method.

Deception is intended since legacy code is sometimes very deceptive!

## Solution

The refactoring steps are recorded as branches in this repository. Start from master (`git checkout master`), then checkout step1 (`git checkout step1`), then step2 (`git checkout step2`), ... until step5 (`git checkout step5`) to  see the whole refactoring in action.
